Assignment 1: Bag of Marbles

This program uses a class to represent a bag of marbles (MarbleBag{}). From
the menu, the user is prompted to add marbles, remove marbles, view the contents
of the marble bag, or exit the program.

- If the user chooses to add marbles, the program prompts for the number of
  marbles to add and for the color of those marbles.

- If the user chooses to remove marbles, the program prompts for the
  of color marble and the number of marbles to remove of that color.

- If the user chooses to view the contents of the bag, the program displays the
  current contents of the bag. If the bag is empty, the program will print the
  message: "the bag is empty".

- Included in the main function is a test to check what happens if marbles are
  removed from an empty bag.

A pdf will be included with my submission to provide screen clips of the code
to show how it meets the requirements for assignment 1.
